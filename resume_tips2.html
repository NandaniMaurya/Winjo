        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by many companies to screen resumes before they reach a human recruiter. Here's how to write an ATS-friendly resume that increases your chances of getting noticed.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Use a Simple Layout</h2>
        <p>Stick to a clean and simple layout. Avoid using fancy formatting, graphics, or tables, as they can confuse the ATS and cause your resume to be rejected.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. Include Relevant Keywords</h2>
        <p>Carefully read the job description and include relevant keywords throughout your resume. These keywords should match the skills and qualifications the employer is looking for.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Use Standard Headings</h2>
        <p>Use standard resume headings like "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", and "Contact Information". ATS software is programmed to look for these common sections.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>4. Avoid Headers and Footers</h2>
        <p>Do not place important information in headers or footers, as ATS software may not read them. Keep all essential details in the main body of the document.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>5. Save as a Word Document or Plain Text</h2>
        <p>While PDFs are widely accepted, some ATS software may have trouble reading them. To be safe, submit your resume as a Word document (.docx) or plain text file (.txt).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>6. Focus on Relevant Experience</h2>
        <p>Highlight your most relevant work experience and skills. Tailor your resume for each job application to show that you are a strong fit for the specific position.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>7. Use Bullet Points</h2>
        <p>Use bullet points to organize information clearly and make it easier for the ATS and recruiters to read. Bullet points help to break up large blocks of text.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By following these tips, you can create a resume that not only passes through the ATS but also stands out to human recruiters. Remember, the goal is to make your resume as clear and relevant as possible.</p>
